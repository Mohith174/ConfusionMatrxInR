# ConfusionMatrix In R
The Data module includes simulated train and test datasets from a study conducted by Company X on the effectiveness of an email marketing campaign. The dependent variable, "none_open_buy," categorizes responses into three groups: 1 for those who did not open the email, 2 for those who opened but didn't purchase, and 3 for those who opened and purchased. Independent variables include whether the recipient had previously purchased from a Company X email (1 for yes, 2 for no), whether they had previously opened an email from Company X (1 for yes, 2 for no), sales of the advertised product in the past year, and "test_var," which indicates one of two email formats (A or B).
Conduct a Naive-Bayes classification analysis using this data. Provide confusion matrices for both the training model and the predictions made on the test data using the trained model.
